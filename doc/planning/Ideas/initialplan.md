# Core Modes

## 1. Improv Song

Split into two levels of complexity:

### Key Definition

The distinction is strictly:

> **Idea Generation Complexity = number of ideas in the prompt**

* Normal Mode = exactly **one idea**
* Difficult Mode = **two or more ideas combined**

---

## 1A. Improv Song – Normal Mode

### Rule

* No combinations

### Categories

* themes
* images
* characters
* situations
* emotions
* places
* goals
* obstacles
* twists
* elements

---

### Prompt Structures

Each category maps to a single-concept prompt:

* “Sing about **{theme}**”
* “Sing about **{image}**”
* “Sing as **{character}**”
* “Sing about **{situation}**”
* “Express **{emotion}**”
